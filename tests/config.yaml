# Integration Test Configuration
#
# This file centralizes test configuration to avoid hardcoding test criteria
# and makes it easy to adapt tests to different email sources and workflows.

# Email Search Configuration
# Used by test_mail_search_results_found and all other test methods
search:
  # Number of days in the past to search (from today)
  days_range: 60

  # Search query criteria - customize for your test data source
  # This query should match emails that:
  # - Arrive regularly (daily, weekly, etc.)
  # - Have consistent structure
  # - Are sufficient for testing (at least 2 emails)
  #
  # Example for USPS Informed Delivery:
  # query: 'subject:"Your Daily Digest" from:"USPS Informed Delivery"'
  #
  # The after:DATE filter is automatically appended based on days_range
  query: 'subject:"Your Daily Digest" from:"USPS Informed Delivery"'

# Label Configuration
# Used by test_mail_label_apply, test_mail_label_remove, and cleanup fixtures
label:
  # Name of the label to use for testing
  # This label will be created if it doesn't exist
  # All tests will add/remove this label from test emails
  test_label: "Test"

# Test Data Expectations
# Validates that sufficient test data exists for reliable testing
test_data:
  # Minimum number of emails expected from search query
  min_results: 2

  # Maximum emails per day in the search window
  # Validates that test data is reasonably distributed
  # E.g., with days_range=60 and max_per_day=1, expect <= 60 total emails
  max_per_day: 1

  # Expected content patterns (for validation)
  # These are checked in test_mail_read_full_details
  expected_fields:
    subject_contains: "Your Daily Digest"
    sender_contains: "USPS"
